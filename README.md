# Web-scraping-demo-with-nodejs
This is demo for web scraping using nodejs. As an example, I saved the data from "books.toscrape.com" as a JSON file. 

Open terminal and write "npm install", it gives required dependencies

Then if write "node genre.js" to the terminal, you take catalogue name in that url from "https://books.toscrape.com"

if write "node books.js" to the terminal, you take all books information (title, price and stock) from "https://books.toscrape.com" and also its saves information into the JSON file (books.json)
